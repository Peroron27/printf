C - Printf group project

This is a collaboration project between Peter Aniefiok and Otavie Okuoyo at ALX software Engineering program.

Project Structure
main directory: Contains the source code files for the printf function and other folders
tests directory: Contains test files for testing the functionality of the printf function
README.mdfile: Contains information about the project
